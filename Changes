        - Don't insert newlines when adding javascript code.

0.99_3  6/23/2006

0.99_1  6/22/2006
        - Wanted to get this code out there before I write more tests.

          bit more clear.
        - Fixed a bug where javascript was attempting to log before the DOM 
          was ready (couldn't find the logging IFrame yet).  Setup a queue
          to log messages until IFrame was found.
        - Streamlined the documentation.
        - New 'abs_uri' attribute to aid in inlining relative src javascript
          files.
        - Now handles both both relative and absolute URI (http and files)
          to inline external javascript
        - New command line script 'jsxray' to filter HTML on your local 
          disk (ie save a page and filter it to see how it works)

        - Major restructuring of the code
            - Refactored sub 'filter' into smaller functions
            - use a regex to find functions instead of spliting lines
            - Now looks for script blocks with 'src' attributes and will
              only inline fully qualified ones with now (via LWP::Simple)
