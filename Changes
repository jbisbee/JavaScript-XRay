1.0     6/26/2006

            * changed all open statements to use the 3 argument open

        * Don't insert newlines when adding javascript code.

0.99_3  6/23/2006
        * Fixed broken code in jsxray.  Method call should have been 
          'inline_methods' and not 'set_inline_methods'
        * Fix documentation of jsxay to change switch 'filter' to 'match'

0.99_2  6/23/2006
        * Added EXED_FILES => [ 'bin/jsxray' ] to the Makefile.PL to install

0.99_1  6/22/2006
        * Wanted to get this code out there before I write more tests.
        * Renamed the 'filter' switch to 'match'
        * Cleaned up the whole switches setting interface to make things a 
          bit more clear.
        * Fixed a bug where javascript was attempting to log before the DOM 
          was ready (couldn't find the logging IFrame yet).  Setup a queue
          to log messages until IFrame was found.
        * Streamlined the documentation.
        * New 'abs_uri' attribute to aid in inlining relative src javascript
          files.
        * Now handles both both relative and absolute URI (http and files)
          to inline external javascript
        * New command line script 'jsxray' to filter HTML on your local 
          disk (ie save a page and filter it to see how it works)
        * New verbose attribute so you can see whats going on.
        * Additional required modules
            * URI
            * Pod::Usage

0.97    6/15/2006
        * Major restructuring of the code
            * Refactored sub 'filter' into smaller functions
            * use a regex to find functions instead of spliting lines
            * Now looks for script blocks with 'src' attributes and will
              only inline fully qualified ones with now (via LWP::Simple)
              <script type="JavaScript" src="http://www.jbisbee.com/test.js">
